Dummy notes, just testing out inserting a README markdown file

Rubric
1. (3 points) Loop through all of the available rides contained within the json variable provided. Each element of the Array is another Array containing the "legs" of the ride. As in the last homework, any ride with more than one leg is considered a "Noober Pool". Traverse this data – you will need more than one loop.
2. (3 points) Print the level of service and information on the ride as illustrated by the design mockup.
3. (3 points) Remember that we're simply working with strings that contain HTML. For each iteration of the loop, you will need to construct two strings that will be inserted into the HTML element with the class name rides – one for the level of service and another for the 1-or-more legs of the ride.
4. (1 point) Empty the rides div element; you should be left with only an empty div element in your HTML, but a page full of data.
